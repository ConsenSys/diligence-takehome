__PLEASE DO NOT FORK THIS REPOSITORY.__

Hello, we're excited to have your interest in ConsenSys Diligence, and we appreciate you taking the time to complete our take home challenge.

## Instructions

In this repository you'll find a contract name `HackableToken.sol`. This is an ERC20 contract, with a totalSupply of tokens based on ETH deposits. A deposit of 1 ETH, get's 1 token. There is an issue with this token, which makes it possible for an attacker to withdraw more than they have deposited!

To complete the challenge:

1. What is your username on https://capturetheether.com ?
1. Write the `Attacker.sol` contract
1. Complete the second test in `test/attack.js`, so that all tests pass.
1. Complete the content in `Vulnerability.md`, according to the headings and comments in that file.

Once complete, send us a zip file containing this repository with your additions.

### Tips

* Use `npm run test` to ensure you're using the same version of truffle as the reviewers.
* You may find it helpful to use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) for writing the contracts.
